# Exploratory Data Analysis of Sales Data

For many companies to remain competitive it's critical that they leverage data analysis and AL/ML to improve their forecasting and future sales models. This usually involves the analyse of historical sales data, exploring customer demand, the current competition, seasonality patterns, the effect of holidays, promotions and much more.

The objective of this project is to carry out analysis of the actual dataset itself in order to determine the characteristics of features, reliability of the data, strenght of detail and any weaknesses and/or missing data in the dataset. The second aim of the project is to explore the data and pull new information and insights wherever possible. Of course Data Analysis would only be the first step for the business. This is usually followed by building perdictive models for forecasing future sales. Additional steps would include Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Model Building and finally deployment.
